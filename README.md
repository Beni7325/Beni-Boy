# Beni Boy Emulator
![alt text](https://github.com/Beni7325/Beni-Boy/blob/main/images/beniboy.png?raw=true)

This code is a rewrite of the GameBoy emulator I wrote during my 2020 Summer vacation.

**Note:** *This repo has been kinda dead because I haven't been able to work on it during this semester due to University.*

TODO (In order of priority):
1. PPU (Pixel Processing Unit)
2. MBC (Memory Bank Controllers)
3. Sound (Maybe?)
